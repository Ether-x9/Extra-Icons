// Explanation as to why this is in a separate file from the rest of the MPE configs:
// I believe there's a conflict with the configs I've added here and the default icons
// included in MPE. I don't know why it only seems to apply to Crokslev, but it does. I
// think the "FINAL" patch fixes the conflict. '
